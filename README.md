This lets you make interactive films

# Tutorial

First, put your data into a file like the example csv file. You can make this with numbers, excel, etc...
The link must be the direct file to the video(eg. http://server.com/video.mp4). I use media fire and copy the download link.
The name, first, firsthint, second, secondhint are text(including numbers).
The end is either true or false. Set it to true if it is an ending.
The second is a number. It's value is the number of seconds the links will be shown before the end of the video.
When it's filled out, convert it to a json file with (http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm) or something similar
